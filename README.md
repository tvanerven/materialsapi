# Materials browser front

All documentation herein is based off [the previous repo](https://github.com/FAIRsFAIR/materials-browser-api). All of it applies.

## Changes made

I had a large amount of difficulty getting the Docker image to work properly and play nice with a reverse proxy. As a result; I compiled to statics and then copied that inside an nginx container (which works predictably.)

This is roughly what the build_package.sh script does as well when you look at it; the only difference is that it's trying to run using ng, which is a hassle in this case with a reverse proxy.

## Compiling to statics

1. Clone repo
2. Run `build_package.sh`
3. `docker build -f Dockerfile-nginx -t <owner/name:tag> .`
4. `docker push`

Now serve from the image.

## Manual changes

Always manually configure the API url, same as it says in the original instruction. You need to set this to the outside of your reverse proxy.
